# Product Features
 1. The app features an email list page. This page shows the list of emails sent to a user.
 2. Clicking on any email item in the list should split the screen into a master-slave (left-right) screen type where the master (left) shows the email list (with the selected email item) while the slave (right) shows the body of the email. The body of the email is not known ahead of time and should be loaded only when the email item is clicked.
3. The app should allow any particular email item to be marked as “favorite”, it should be done via clicking on an email item and then clicking the “Mark as Favorite” button in the email body section.
 4. The app should show read and unread mails in different CSS styles to distinguish between the same.
 5. Allow filtering emails by “favorites”, “read” and “unread”.
 6. Email list could be long and hence is paginated. There are 2 pages i.e. page 1 and page 2 which can be accessed via the APIs provided below. 
 7. Persist favorited and read emails across sessions using persistent storage technologies Points to consider:
